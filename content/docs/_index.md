Welcome to the Rez user guide! This guide shows you how to get started with Rez.

## What is Rez?

Rez is a cross-platform package manager with a difference. Using Rez you can create standalone environments configured for a given set of packages. However, unlike many other package managers, packages are not installed into these standalone environments. Instead, all package versions are installed into a central repository, and standalone environments reference these existing packages. This means that configured environments are lightweight, and very fast to create, often taking just a few seconds to configure despite containing hundreds of packages.
